<p>John Baskerville (1706–1775) was an English businessman whose entrepreneurial
   attentions included japanning and papier-mâché; he is, however, best
   remembered as a typographer and printer, not least for the design of the
   eponymous typeface which, to this very day, bears his name.</p>

<p>Baskerville was born in the village of Wolverley, near Kidderminster in
  Worcestershire, and worked as a printer in Birmingham. Baskerville printed
  works for the University of Cambridge and, although an atheist, printed a
  splendid folio bible in 1763. His typefaces were greatly admired by Benjamin
  Franklin, a printer and fellow member of the Royal Society of Arts, who took
  the designs back to the newly-created United States, where they were adopted
  for most federal government publishing.</p>

<p>Baskerville was responsible for numerous innovations in printing, paper and
  ink production. He developed a technique which produced a smoother whiter
  paper which showcased his strong black type. He also pioneered a completely
  new style of typography, adding wide margins and generous leading to improve
  legibility.</p>

<p>“Having been an early admirer of the beauty of letters, I became insensibly
  desirous of contributing to the perfection of them. I formed to myself ideas
  of greater accuracy than had yet appeared, and had endeavoured to produce a
  set of types according to what I conceived to be their true proportion.”</p>

  <p>—John Baskerville, preface to Milton, 1758 (Anatomy of a Typeface)</p>

<p>Baskerville is a Transitional serif typeface designed by John Baskerville in
  1757, positioned between the Old Style typefaces of William Caslon, and the
  modern styles of Giambattista Bodoni and Firmin Didot.</p>

<p>The typeface is the result of Baskerville’s intent to improve upon the types
   of William Caslon. He increased the contrast between thick and thin strokes,
   making the serifs sharper and more tapered, and shifted the axis of rounded
   letters to a more vertical position. The curved strokes are more circular in
   shape, and the characters became more regular. These changes created a
   greater consistency in size and form.</p>

<p>Baskerville’s work was criticised by jealous competitors and soon fell out of
   favour. Since the 1920s, however, numerous revivals of Baskerville have been
   released by Linotype, Monotype, and other type foundries.
   <a href="https://www.emigre.com/" >Émigré </a>  released a
   popular revival of the typeface in 1996 called Mrs Eaves, named for
   Baskerville’s wife, Sarah Eaves. Baskerville represents the peak of
   Transitional type face design and bridges the gap between Old Style and
   Modern type design.</p>

<p>Mrs Eaves is named after Sarah Eaves, the woman who became John Baskerville’s
   wife. As Baskerville was setting up his printing and type business, Mrs.
   Eaves moved in with him as a live-in housekeeper, eventually becoming his
   wife after the death of her first husband, Mr. Eaves. Mrs Eaves is a revival
   of the types of English printer and punchcutter John Baskerville, and is
   related to contemporary Baskerville typefaces.</p>

<p>Like Baskerville, Mrs Eaves, cut by Zuzana Licko of Émigré, has a near
  vertical stress, departing from the Old Style model. Identifying characters,
  similar to Baskerville’s types, are the lowercase g with its open lower
  counter and swash-like ear. Both the roman and italic uppercase Q have a
  flowing swash-like tail. The uppercase C has serifs at top and bottom; there
  is no serif at the apex of the central junction in uppercase W; and the
  uppercase G has a sharp spur suggesting a vestigial serif.</p>
